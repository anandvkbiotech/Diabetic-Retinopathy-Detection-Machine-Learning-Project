# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-Machine-Learning-Project
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting and predicting diabetic retinopathy. Using a dataset of patient information regarding their Age, BMI, Insulin, Outcome, Skin etc..
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes, caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina due to high blood sugar levels over time. It is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide but is preventable with early detection and appropriate management.
**Causes and Risk Factors**
1. **High Blood Sugar:** Over time, elevated glucose levels can damage the small blood vessels in the retina, leading to leakage, swelling, and the growth of new abnormal blood vessels.
2. **Duration of Diabetes:** The longer a person has diabetes, the higher the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy.
3. **Poor Blood Sugar Control:** Inconsistent blood sugar levels can accelerate the progression of the disease.
4. **Other Risk Factors:** High blood pressure, High cholesterol & BMI, Smoking & Poor health Maintance, Pregnancy (for women with diabetes)

The project is built using Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Future work includes deploying the model via a web API and integrating real-world datasets for validation.
